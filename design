Each block in the workflow has the following info:

- ID
- Script to call
- Argument string (built with previous outputs)
- Number of expected outputs (and optional names of outputs, default to arg1, ...) *** _output, _split_output are a reseved name
- (Optional) Regex for seperating output into variables (default to space)
- (Optional) file to send output to
- (Optional) file to send stderr to
- (Optional) Expected return code (default to zero)
	- Should be able to indicate nonzero OK (i.e. for grep)

OR, just limit it to ints and strings and infer the type.
E.g. x>2, x must be an int, y=="t", y must be a string.
OR just put the onus on condition writer (e.g. require wrapping w/ int() if doing integer comparison)

* Can reuse output names, but then the old value is overwritten
* Should check return code, error if bad
* Need some way of representing connections between blocks
	- Maybe have two files, one of block definitions and one of connections?
	- Default connection would be "unconditional goto"
	- Optional conditionals for more filtering
	- E.g. if you connected block 1 and 2, then 1 again the block definiton file would just have defs for blocks 1 and 2. Then the connection file would have the program order"1 unconditionally goes to 2, 2 unconditionally goes to 1"

Connection file:
Assumption that each script returns control to workflow.
Sorta like python, e.g.

b1
if x > 2:
	b3
	if y:
		b4
else
	b4

Useful to add 'compiler' checks to make sure everything generated was sane? Or no cause its autogenerated anyway.
